            <h1>--ALCATRAZ</h1>
            <p class="blue">According to the Alcatraz tour, I learned that the prison existed between 1934 to 1963.It s located in San 
                Francisco Bay, 1.25 miles (2.01 km) offshore from San Francisco, California, United States. The small island 
                was developed with facilities for a lighthouse, a military fortification, a military prison (1868), 
                and a federal prison from 1934 until 1963.[5] Beginning in November 1969, the island was occupied for 
                more than 19 months by a group of Native Americans from San Francisco, who were part of a wave of Native 
                activism across the nation, with public protests through the 1970s. In 1972, Alcatraz became part of a 
                national recreation area and received designation as a National Historic Landmark in 1986.</p>
